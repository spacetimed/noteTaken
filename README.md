# noteTaken

A lightweight and minimalist **markdown note taker** for web browsers.

This project is meant to provide "quick note taking" with a markdown preview, offering an easy "copy to clipboard" option prior to departure.

This project uses:
* React
* SASS / SCSS
* Material UI (MUI)

## Planned implementations:
* Avoid using `dangerousSetInnerHtml`
* **Bug fix:** Cursor location is incorrect if word wrap occurs in the code editor.
* **Bug fix:** Cursor location is incorrect on mobile.
* Responsiveness breaks on "extreme" resolutions. (very small resolutions)
